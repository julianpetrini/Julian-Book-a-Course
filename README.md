# Julian-Book-a-Course

Project context : A friend wants to sell her language courses online and has asked you to create a small website that allows to test how her booking process would look and feel on mobile devices.

Project for the "Opportunity" ZÃ¼rich Stadt Software-learning course.

This is my process:

First, I have created and organized a Trello board to organize the workflow.
Then I created the identity of the brand, including logo design, colors, type of font.
I've transferred all my initial thoughts into Figma to feel how it would be.
After that, I've started to work on the code and creating different branches to work in a safe and organized environment.
There is much to learn and organize but here I find a starting point.
Thanks for your time.
