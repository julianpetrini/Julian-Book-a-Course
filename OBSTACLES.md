Obstacles :

First of all, I would like to say that I always see them as an opportunity to learn. How to be creative, how to solve, and how to grow from a certain point. 

Since I'm quite new with all the processes I wanted to go as fast as I could to the code, but first Figma. After some tutorials, I could improve my understanding but not as fully as to express my ideas into it, as congruence with my mind.

Then I started.

I wanted to do the responsive site using the Grid system and media quires on CSS instead of Bootstrap to learn more about the behavior of all the components. 

I've followed some basic structure pieces of advice and all was doing quite well.

Then I've realized that in order to do this in an efficient way I need to improve my CSS skills (order and organization) if I don't use Sass.

After long coding, I felt I was near. That feeling was embracing me occasionally.

Once I've made the structure and look quite as I planned to I went to javascript. This was really good, maybe because it wasn't so complicated what I needed to perform or because more or less it is becoming my everyday tool. 

I had a lot of moments where you don't find a solution but I'm developing my way of translating them into questions. Once you have the proper question the answers will come. Sooner than later.

Some of the answers came by just watching the code after a break with the sun in my forehead and some of them from StackOverflow, w3schools, MDN, or asking a colleague nearby.

I don't know about the end result, but for sure I learned a lot in the process. 
Thanks for your time if you ended up reading this.
Sincerely
Julian Petrini JÃ¤ggli
